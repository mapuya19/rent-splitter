## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Chatbot Feature

The application includes an AI-powered chatbot assistant that helps users:

- **Fill out forms automatically** - Tell the chatbot your rent, utilities, and roommate info in natural language
- **Answer questions** - Learn about features, split methods, and how the app works
- **Smart extraction** - The AI extracts structured data from conversational input (rent amounts, incomes, room sizes, etc.)
- **Mobile-optimized** - Fully responsive chatbot interface that adapts to mobile screen sizes
- **Smooth animations** - Polished UI with fade-in, slide, and scale animations for better user experience

The chatbot uses Llama 3.1 8B Instant model via Groq API with a rules-based fallback for reliability.
